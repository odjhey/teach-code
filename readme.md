## SOLID Principle

1. **S**ingle Responsibility
1. **O**pen/closed Principle  
  Open for extension/closed for modification
1. **L**iskov substitution Principle  
  TBD - Type inheritance systems  
  e.g. Square cannot inherit a rectangle  
  Another classic goes, "Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs batteries, is probably not a duck"
1. **I**nterface Segregation  
  No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
1. **D**ependency Inversion  
  high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.  Details should depend upon abstractions.
